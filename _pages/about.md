I'm a Staff Research Engineer at [Common Sense Machines (CSM)](https://www.csm.ai/) and a visiting researcher at NYU in [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/)'s group. My work focuses on foundation models that simulate the 3D world and generalist dexterous robots that interact with the 3D world. I specialize in scaling up deep neural networks from 0.

I received my BA in Mathematics and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, advised by [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/). As an undergraduate, I interned at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) on the AI team, where I reported to [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), and previously at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) on the Applied AI team. I wrote my Master's thesis on adversarial methods for end-to-end text-to-speech, which I lectured on for [CS 236G: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://cs236g.stanford.edu/). I've been fortunate to work with professors [Tatsu Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/), [Noah Goodman](https://cocolab.stanford.edu/ndg), and [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) in their respective groups.
