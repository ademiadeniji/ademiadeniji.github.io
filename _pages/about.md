I am a Computer Science PhD student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). My goal is to develop a generally intelligent agent capable of autonomous learning in the real world. I believe scaling the human physical data footprint is on the critical path to resolving [Moravec's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox). 

Currently, I'm developing zero-shot human-to-robot learning capabilities with Professor [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/)'s group at NYU as a visiting scholar. Follow me [on X](https://x.com/AdemiAdeniji) for updates on my work.

I received my BS (Honors) and MS in computer science with specialization in artificial intelligence from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), conducting research under the adivsorship of [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li) as well as [Kuan Fang](https://kuanfang.github.io) and [Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech). I interned at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) conducting reinforcement learning, robotics, and simulation research mentored by [Yuke Zhu](https://yukezhu.me) and [Jim Fan](https://jimfan.me). Before then, I worked on machine learning and automation at [Google](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/teams/engineering-technology/) and digital transformation at [McKinsey and Company](https://www.mckinsey.com).
