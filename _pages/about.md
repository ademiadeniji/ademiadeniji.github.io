I'm building a new company to scale up human-centric robotics in the real world. Currently, I'm developing zero-shot human-to-robot learning capabilities with Professor [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/)'s group at NYU. Follow me [on X](https://x.com/vincentjliu) for updates on my work.

I received my BA in Mathematics and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, advised by [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/). Before NYU, I developed 3D world models for gaming and simulation at [CSM](https://csm.ai). As an undergraduate, I worked at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) AI reporting to [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) and also at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) Applied AI. I wrote my MS Distinction in Research on adversarial methods for end-to-end text-to-speech, which I lectured on for [CS 236G: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://cs236g.stanford.edu/). My earlier academic work spanned multi-task learning and self-supervised learning with professors [Tatsu Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/), [Noah Goodman](https://cocolab.stanford.edu/ndg), and [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) in their respective groups.
