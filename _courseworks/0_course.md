I helped create and teach [CS 236G: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://cs236g.stanford.edu), which also became a [Coursera course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-specialization/). I designed advanced material based on papers such as [Pix2PixHD](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11E-YhRUAMMdzjN70ee9N08q6eRAX338r?usp=sharing), [GauGAN](https://github.com/vliu15/gaugan), [SRGAN](https://github.com/vliu15/srgan), [BigGAN](https://github.com/vliu15/biggan), and [MUNIT](https://github.com/vliu15/munit). I created and led Pytorch tutorial workshops covering topics such as GPU utilization, mixed precision, distributed training, and debugging mode collapse, and also gave a guest lecture on adversarial methods in speech synthesis.
