I helped train and scale CSM's [Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) Foundation Model](https://www.csm.ai/blog/image-to-3d-in-seconds-is-now-better-than-ever), a 2D-native NeRF model that reconstructs 3D occupancy fields from single image in <1 minute. This model plugs into a slow refinement process based on [Poole et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14988) and grew CSM to over 300k+ users. My work was presented at NVIDIA GTC 2024.
