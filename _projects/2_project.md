I developed adversarial methods for end-to-end text-to-speech models as part of my Master's thesis. I also lectured on these concepts for Stanford's [CS 236G: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://cs236g.stanford.edu/) Winter 2021 offering. Here are some samples from [my implementation](https://github.com/vliu15/tts-gan), which is an adaptation of ([Donahue et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03575); [Kim et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11129))
